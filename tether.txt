USB Tethering on Linux

I've seen people asking about USB Tethering on Linux and they were having problems with it. Well, turns out it is so much simpler than it looks/seems.

Before you start, make sure you have chosen the option of USB Tethering on the phone !

First of all, make sure you have module usbnet loaded.

    modprobe usbnet


Yes, that's it to load the module if it's not loaded.

Secondly, if you are using ifconfig you simply do:

    ifconfig -a


You should see a usb0 interface. If you are using something else, work accordingly. I use ifconfig.

Anyway, next step is putting interface up and getting IPs.

    ifconfig usb0 up
    dhcpcd usb0


And that's it boys and girls, your internet is working.

these additional steps may be needed (?)

1. connect your mobile with wifi

2. connect mobile using usb to your laptop where ubuntu server is installed

go to your android mobile settings ->wireless & networks -> more ->Tithering & portable hotspot
press USB tethering
3. in command line in ur pc:

    ifconfig usb0 up

    dhcpclient usb0

then thats it!

you should be connected to internet via your phone





=============================================================

another take

The gist is that we use the usbnet driver and the Linux RNDIS implementation (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) to spawn another network interface usbX, over which we can establish a network connection as usual.
First, load the necessary kernel modules:
    $ modprobe usbnet
    $ modprobe rndis_host

Second, connect the phone via USB and enable USB tethering, for example: Settings > Wireless and networks > More settings > Tethering and portable hotspot > check the "USB tethering entry". In my case, Android somehow fails to detect the computer properly when the USB cable was already plugged in before turning the computer on...oh noes.

Third, run
    $ ip link
You should see a device named usbX, where X is a number, that is an entry like this:
    $ ip link
    # ...
    7: usb0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 50
    link/ether 02:06:06:52:32:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Fourth, establish a network connection using DHCP, for example using network-manager. If you don't use any network manager, dhclient is good for this (from the 'isc-dhcp-client' package):
    $ dhclient usb0
Check whether the routing table has been set up correctly, for example:
    $ route
    Kernel IP routing table
    Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
    default         192.168.42.129  0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 usb0
    192.168.42.0    *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 usb0

You should now be able to connect to the internet. To release the DHCP lease after having ended the tethering, do
    $ dhclient -r usb0

If all went well, you might want to load the kernel modules at boot time: Add these lines to /etc/modules:
usbnet
rndis_host
Done.
